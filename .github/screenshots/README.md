# Screenshots

Add your UI screenshots here with these exact filenames:

1. **dashboard.png** - Home screen with storage/CPU stats
2. **shows.png** - TV Shows library view
3. **movies.png** - Movies library view
4. **movie-detail.png** - Movie details page with play button

## How to Add Screenshots

### From your screenshots (shown in chat):

1. Save the 4 screenshots you showed me to this directory:
   ```
   .github/screenshots/dashboard.png
   .github/screenshots/shows.png
   .github/screenshots/movies.png
   .github/screenshots/movie-detail.png
   ```

2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .github/screenshots/
   git commit -m "Add UI screenshots to README"
   git push
   ```

### Tips for Best Quality:

- Use PNG format for crisp quality
- Mobile screenshots work great (these are from your PWA)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB each)
- Screenshots should show the actual UI, not marketing material
